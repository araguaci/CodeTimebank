              Timebanking is a time-based currency. Give one hour of service to
              another, and receive one time credit. You can use the credits in
              turn to receive services â€” or you can donate them to others.
              <br />
              <b>
                An hour of service is always one time credit regardless of the
                nature of the service performed.

            Our users that help others the most will show up near the top of the
            leaderboards. Tech recruiters and our community in general can see
            who the most altruistic members are. Using the Github API, we can
            show recruiters whether or not they're hireable. Similarly,
            community members can look on the leaderboards to find out who
            answered what, and possibly seek advice from our most knowledgeable
            members.
